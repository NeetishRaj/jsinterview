# JS Interview

This interview tries to assess the analytical and data manipulation skill of a JS developer.

# Goals

- Determine your level of engineering experience

# Instructions

> This exercise should take about 30 minutes.

- Briefly review the dataset of survey responses in `data.json` to understand the data you're working with and the tests in `index.test.js`.
- Update the `count_survey_responses` function in `index.js` so that it returns the total count of each response to to each survey.
  - Your goal should be to write the function in such a way that all of the tests in `index.test.js` pass. **NOTE:** The tests are expecting the data to be returned in a very specific way.
  - All of your code should be written in the `index.js` file.
- You are welcome to clone the repo and create a branch to share, but do **not open a pull request**
